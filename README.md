# Angkor Boy

A 2D adventure game set in the beautiful landscapes of Cambodia. This project is built with Python and the Pygame library.

## Current State

This project is in its very early stages of development. Currently, it is a basic skeleton that initializes a Pygame window and displays a black screen. The core structure for the game loop, player, and world is in place, but with no implemented logic yet.

## Getting Started

To run the current version of the game, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository (if you haven't already):**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/angkor-boy.git
    cd angkor-boy
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows
    venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS and Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    The only dependency for this project is Pygame.
    ```bash
    pip install pygame
    ```

### Running the Game

Once you have installed the dependencies, you can run the game with the following command:

```bash
python angkor_boy/main.py
```

This will launch a window with a black screen. To exit, simply close the window.
